## Mailing Lists
There is a CDAT mailing list that allows users/developers to exchange ideas,
information, tips, and discuss development issues. It is also intended for
helping new CDAT users who need general questions answered. SourceForge hosts
the CDAT mailing list. For more information and to subscribe, please visit the
URL:

At this same URL, you can also access or view or report bugs, and make CDAT contributions.

To send a one time only question: email at:
