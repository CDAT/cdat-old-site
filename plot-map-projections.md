##  Plot Map Projections
Goal:  To introduce you to VCS plot map projections. 

Reselect the "clt" Variable in the "Variable" selection window. This will
reinitialize the "Dimension Manipulation Panel". Select the orange "Plot"
button to display the "clt" data set. Make sure the graphics method selected
is "Boxfill".

Each map projection has specific properties that make it useful to highlight
certain regions of the map. Projections are useful to show true directions,
distances, areas and shapes.
