##  VCS Canvas Page Orientation
Goal:  To introduce you to VCS Canvas page orientation (i.e., Landscape or Portrait) 

Reselect the "clt" Variable in the "Variable"&#160; selection window. This will
reinitialize the "Dimension Manipulation Panel". Select the orange "Plot"
button to display the "clt" data set.  

The VCS Canvas display can be in either one of the two orientations:
"Landscape" (default orientation) or "Portrait".

To specify the canvas orientation, depress the "Option" menu to the right of
"VCS Canvas 1". Then move the pointer over "Page Orientation" and select
either "Landscape" or "Portrait". Select the plot button to see the
orientation change. Note, if something is plotted on the VCS Canvas, then it
will be cleared and automatically replotted.

For our example, select the "Portrait" menu item. The plot will automatically
be redisplayed. See figure 13 for the portait display. Repeat the process and
select the "Landscape" menu item. See figure 12 for the landscape display.
