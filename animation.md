The contents of the VCS Canvas can be animated and controlled by command line
or by a GUI.  

Before viewing the animation editor, reset the time dimension to a smaller
range for animate over. Set the time dimension range to start at "1980-1-1
0:0" and end at "1985-12-1 0:0".&#160; Then select the orange "Plot" button to
display to replot the plot with the specified time dimension.  

To view and control animation via the GUI, depress the "Option" menu to the
right of "VCS Canvas 1". Then move the pointer over the "Animate..." item and
select.
