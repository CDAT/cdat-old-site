The VCS Canvas is the drawing area where the graphics method, picture
template, and data are combined to show a plot.

To specify one of four canvases or background canvas, depress the "VCS Canvas
1" choice button to the right of "Boxfill":

Then move the pointer over the desired canvas and select the "Plot" button.

###Clear and close the VCS Canvas: 
By default, "VCS Canvas 1" is used to plot results. If you haven't done so
already, select the orange "Plot" button to display the selected "clt" data.
Now clear the display by depressing the "VCS Canvas 1" choice button and
selecting the "Clear VCS Canvas 1" menu option. Now remove the canvas from the
screen by depressing the "VCS Canvas 1" choice button and selecting the "Close
VCS Canvas 1" menu option.  

Select the orange "Plot" button to re-plot the "clt" data.  

Note: You can also minimize, maximize, move, and close the VCS Canvas via
the Window Manager. At this time, these functions on the VCS Canvas window are
limited to your Window Manager's policies and procedures.  

###Viewing more than one VCS Canvas:   
To view data in another canvas, depress the "VCS Canvas 1" choice button and select the "VCS Canvas 2" menu option. Now select the orange "Plot" button to display the "clt" data in the second VCS Canvas. Repeat this process for "VCS Canvas 3" and "VCS Canvas 4".   

Close all canvases via the predescriped methods above and reset the to "VCS
Canvas 1" and replot the "clt" data set.  

###Displaying data information directly from the plot:   
The plot itself will display data information to the users. That is, if requested it will return X and Y array index and coordinate information, the data value, and color map index value used for the data display at any given point on the plot.   

Move the pointer to any location within the displayed Boxfill graphics method
on the VCS Canvas. Select and hold down the left mouse button and a data
information window will be displayed. Releasing the left mouse button will
cause the window to vanish. Repeat this process until you become familiar with
this feature. Figure 10 shows a data information window in the VCS Canvas.
