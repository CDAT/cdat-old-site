Goal:  To introduce you to Continental outlines. 

Reselect the "clt" Variable in the "Variable" selection window. This will
reinitialize the "Dimension Manipulation Panel". Select the orange "Plot"

There are five predefined continental outlines and six that the user can
define.

To specify a continental outline, depress the "Option" menu to the right of
"VCS Canvas 1". Then move the pointer over "Continents Types" and over the
desired continental outline. By default, "Auto Continents" will generate "Fine
Continents".  

For our example, select "United States Continents", then the orange "Plot"
button. See figure 11 for plot results.
