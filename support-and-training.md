As with every community software product, we are very interested in your
comments, suggestions for improvements, work-arounds, and bug reports. The bug
report database is also hosted by SourceForge and can be found at the URL:

The CDAT community is growing rapidly and becoming much too large for
individual user support. Fortunately, there are a lot of really savvy CDAT
users who are willing to help others and/or willing to contribute to the
development and growth of CDAT. Please visit the URL above to find additional
support documentation, tutorials on CDAT, and FAQs.

 Special Note:  On occasion, members of the core CDAT development team present tutorials on the installation, use, and development of CDAT.
