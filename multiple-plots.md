#  Multiple Plots on a VCS Canvas
Goal:  To introduce you to multiple plots on a VCS Canvas page. 

Reselect the "clt" Variable in the "Variable" selection window. This will
reinitialize the "Dimension Manipulation Panel". Select the orange "Plot"
button to display the "clt" data set. Make sure the graphics method selected
is "Boxfill".

The VCS Canvas is described as a page since its output (i.e., postscript, GIF,
CGM, etc.) is printed on paper in either "landscape" or "portrait"
orientation.

To change the number of plots on a page, depress the "Option" menu to the
right of "VCS Canvas 1". Then move the pointer over the "Number of Plots on
VCS Canvas" item and select "2 Plots".  

![Multiple_plot_2](media/images/multiple_plot_2)

The VCS Canvas will automatically clear if there is a plot displayed. Select
the "Plot" button to see the first boxfill plot. Change the graphics method to
"Isofill", then select "u" in the "Variable" input text window and select the
"Plot" button for the second time. See figure 25.  

Be sure to reset the "Number of Plots on VCS Canvas" back to "1 Plot" before
moving on to the next example.

Select the graphics method back to"Boxfill".
