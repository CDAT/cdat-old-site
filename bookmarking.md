##  Bookmarking Directories and Files
Goal:  learn to use VCDAT's bookmarking capabilities so you can easily work with frequently used files and directories. 

To set a bookmark for your favorite working directories, select the folder
bookmark icon ![Bookmark Folder](media/images/bookmark-folder) to the right of the
"Directory" input text window. (See figure 1.) A popup window will appear for
setting your directory bookmarks. (See figure 4.) In the popup window, select
the "Add Directory" button to add `<CDAT_SRC_DIRECTORY>/Packages/dat` to the
working directories list.  
  

To set a bookmark for your favorite working files and/or URLs, select the file
bookmark icon ![Bookmark File](media/images/bookmark-file) to the right of the "File"
input text window. (See figure 1.) A popup window will appear for setting your
file and URL bookmarks. (See figure 5.)  

To retrieve bookmarks, select the appropriate directory or file retrieval
icon: ![Get Bookmark Folder](media/images/get-bookmark-folder) for directories and
![Get Bookmark File](media/images/get-bookmark-file) for files and URLs. Bookmark
additonal directories and files, then select the appropriate icons to view
your saved directories and files.  

Remember:  when you 'bookmark' a directory, file, or URL, you are telling VCDAT to remember for easy recall, without having to retype text again.
