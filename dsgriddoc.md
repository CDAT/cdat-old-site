* Overview of the CDAT interface to dsgrid    
  
###INTRODUCTION TO NGMATH  
  
The ngmath library is a collection of interpolators and approximators for one-
dimensional, two-dimensional  
and three-dimensional data. The packages, which were obtained from NCAR, are:  
  
natgrid -- a two-dimensional random data interpolation package based on Dave
Watson's nngridr.  
  
dsgrid -- a three-dimensional random data interpolator based on a simple
inverse distance weighting  
algorithm.  
  
fitgrid -- an interpolation package for one-dimensional and two-dimensional
gridded data based on  
Alan Cline's Fitpack. Fitpack uses splines under tension to interpolate in one
and two  
dimensions.  
  
csagrid -- an approximation package for one-dimensional, two-dimensional and
three-dimensional random  
data based on David Fulker's Splpack. csagrid uses cubic splines to calculate
its  
approximation function.  
  
cssgrid -- an interpolation package for random data on the surface of a sphere
based on the work of  
Robert Renka. cssgrid uses cubic splines to calculate its interpolation
function.  
  
shgrid -- an interpolation package for random data in 3-space based on the
work of Robert Renka.  
shgrid uses a modified Shepard's algorithm to calculate its interpolation
function.  
  
###COMPARISION OF NGMATH PACKAGES  
  
Three-dimensional packages -- shgrid, csagrid and dsgrid.  
  
shgrid is probably the package of choice for interpolation. It uses a least
squares fit of biquadratics  
to construct its interpolation function. The interpolation function will pass
through the original data  
points.  
  
csagrid uses a least squares fit of cubic splines to calculate its
approximation function: the calculated  
surface will not necesarily pass through the original data points. The
algorithm can become unstable in data  
sparse regions.  
  
dsgrid uses a weighted average algorithm and is stable in all cases, but the
resultant interpolation is  
not usually smooth and execution time is very slow. dsgrid is probably best
used when csagrid and shgrid  
fail or for comparative purposes.  
  
Two-dimensional packages -- natgrid, fitgrid, csagrid and dsgrid.  
  
natgrid is the package of choice in most cases. It implements a very stable
algorithm and has parameters  
for adjusting the smoothness of the output surface.  
  
fitgrid offers user-settable parameters for specifiying derivatives along the
boundary of the output grid  
which are not available in natgrid.  
  
csagrid produces an approximate two-dimensional surface which may be smoother
than that produced by fitgrid  
and natgrid.  
  
dsgrid is not recommended for two-dimensional surfaces. natgrid is superior in
all respects.  
  
One-dimensional packages -- fitgrid and csagrid.  
  
fitgrid is definitely the package of choice. It has many features not
available in csagrid, such as  
interpolating parametric curves, finding integrals, handling periodic
functions, allowing smoothing that  
varies from linear to a full cubic spline interpolation and specifying slopes
at the end points.  
  
Interpolation on a sphere -- cssgrid.  
  
cssgrid is designed specifically for interpolating on a sphere. It uses cubic
splines to calculate an  
interpolation function.  
  
###DSGRID PACKAGE  
  
dsgrid implements a simple weighted average interpolation algorithm. The input
for the interpolation is a set  
of randomly spaced two or three-dimensional coordinates with functional values
at those coordinates; the output  
is a set of interpolated values at the user specified coordinates. The
coordinates may be in a list or a gridded  
format. The coordinates in the output grid must be monotonically increasing in
each coordinate direction, but need  
not be evenly spaced.  
  
dsgrid uses a simple weighted average method to do its interpolation, the
value of the weights being inversely  
proportional to the distance form an input coordinate to the point where the
interpolated value is desired. As  
the default, the influence varies as the the inverse cube of the distance. The
sum of the weights is normalized  
to unity and an interpolated value is the sum of the the products of the known
functional values and the  
calculated weights. The capability exits to vary the power of the distances
used to compute the weights. For  
powers greater than one, the interpolated surface is flat at the input data:
the size of the spot increases with  
increasing values of the power. If the power of the distances is one, the
weights are computed as the linear  
inverse distances and the areas around input data are cone shaped. If the
power of the distances is less than one,  
the areas around input data form a cusp at the data points.  
  
###DSGRID CONTENTS  
  
Access through Python to the dsgrid package from NCAR's ngmath distribution is
provided directly through the module  
dsgridmodule.so which was generated as a Python C language extension in order
to export the functions from the  
original C language library  
  
###REQUIRED FILE  
  
    dsgridmodule.so -- the Python interface to the ngmath dsgrid package.  
  
###USEFUL FILES  
  
ds.py \-- the object oriented interface including a general help
package.  
dsgridtest.py -- the code to test ds.py and to write documentation.  
  
###USAGE  
  
This module is designed to use in two ways. One is through the use of the
object oriented interface to the underlying  
functions. This approach is recommended for users not already familiar with
the original dsgrid distribution because  
it simplifies the calls to the routines. The other method uses the original
functions calling them directly from Python.  
  
##OBJECT ORIENTED APPROACH  
The ds module contains the Dsgrid class and the single method rgrd  
  
###STEP 1.  
  
Rectangular Gridded Output Coordinates  
  
To make an instance, r, type:  
  
    import ds  
    r = ds.Dsgrid(xi, xo, yi, yo)  
  
or  
  
    r = ds.Dsgrid(xi, xo, yi, yo, zi, zo)  
  
where xi, yi and zi are the input coordinate arrays in list format  
while xo, yo and zo are the and output grid coordinate arrays which  
must be increasing but not necessarily evenly spaced.  
  
List Format Output Coordinates  
  
To make an instance, r, type:  
  
    import ds  
    r = ds.Dsgrid(xi, xo, yi, yo, griddedOutput = 'no')  
  
or  
  
    r = ds.Dsgrid(xi, xo, yi, yo, zi, zo, griddedOutput = 'no')  
  
where xi, yi and zi are the input coordinate arrays in list format  
and xo, yo and zo are the output coordinate arrays in list format.  
  
DSGRID has regridding functions which carry out their respective
interpolations in single  
or double precision. The choice is determined by the type of the coordinate
arrays submitted  
in makking the instance.  
  
###STEP 2.  
  
Gridded output or list output is accessed with the same call to the method
function, rgrd.  
The choice is made in the creation of an instance of the Dsgrid class in STEP
1.  
  
Type  
dataOut = r.rgrd(dataIn) where  
  
dataIn \-- input data in list form  
dataOut -- output data in gridded or list form  

##ORIGINAL FUNCTION APPROACH  
The module dsgridmodule.so exports the following functions to Python from the
original C library:  
  
Single precision procedures:  
  
grid2s \- primary function for gridding 2D data.  
grid3s \- primary function for gridding 3D data.  
seti \- set int parameter values.  
geti \- retrieve values for int parameters.  
setr \- set float parameter values.  
getr \- retrieve values for float parameters  
setc \- set char parameter values.  
getc \- retrieve values for char parameters.  
pnt2s \- interpolate 2D data at specified individual points.  
pnt3s \- interpolate 3D data at specified individual points.  
  
  
Double precision procedures:  
  
grid2d \- primary function for gridding 2D data.  
grid3d \- primary function for gridding 3D data.  
setrd \- set float parameter values.  
getrd \- retrieve values for float parameters  
pnt2d \- interpolate 2D data at specified individual points.  
pnt3d \- interpolate 3D data at specified individual points.  
  
Information on the use of the routines is available by importing dsgridmodule
and printing the docstring  
of interest. For example, documentation for the routine grid2s is obtained by
typing  
  
    import dsgridmodule  
    print dsgridmodule.grid2s.__doc__  
  
This same information is available in the help package.  
  
    import ds  
    print ds.help('grid2s')  
  
A description of the control parameters is not in the dsgridmodule
documentation. It can be found by typing  
  
    import ds  
    ds.printParameterTable()  
  
A hard copy of the full documentation on the use of each of the routines is
written to the file dsgrid.doc after  
importing ds by typing  
  
  ds.document()  
  
###DOCUMENTATION  
  
Documentation is provided through Python's docstrings, essentially Python
style program comments. A help package  
provides instructions on the use of dsgrid. A table of contents is printed to
the screen by typing  
  
    ds.help()  
  
after importing ds.  
  
A hard copy of this documentation is written to the file dsgridmodule.doc
after import dsgridtest by typing  
  
    dsgridtest.document()  
  
###TESTING  
  
To run a test of the 2D and 3D interpolations and to get a copy of this
documentation, type  
  
    cdat dsgridtest.py
