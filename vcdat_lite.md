##  What is VCDAT Lite?
Goal:  Description of VCDAT Lite. 

The  Lite Version of Visual Climate Analysis Tools (VCDAT)  was introduced
in the CDAT v.4.3 and features a simplified interface tailored for the
functionality and easy of use.&#160; All the most commonly used features are
included in it, and the interface is slightly redesign to add some basic but
extremally handy functionality for the biginner as well as advanced user.

Compare the  VCDAT Lite  version:

and  VCDAT full version  :

 VCDAT Lite  is meant to be a 'lite' version of VCDAT and as such, it is stripped from the template edit and variables calculation window, as shown in the images above.   

The advanced user can easily s [ witch to the full version ](/to-full-version)
of the VCDAT, and can also make this look and feel - a default look, so that
each time he/she opens the VCDAT it will open in the full mode.

By default the VCDAT will open in the Lite Version.&#160; You can [ switch the
default look and feel ](/changing-default) into a Full VCDAT version, if you
so desire.
