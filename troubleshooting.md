If problems occur when building any part of the CDAT component software, you
can view the build error of an individual package in its log file, which is
located in the directory:

  * ` <CDAT_SRC_DIRECTORY>/logs `

Example logs can be found in the following directory:

  * ` <CDAT_SRC_DIRECTORY>/logs/samples `

As always the best way is to email the discussion list:
