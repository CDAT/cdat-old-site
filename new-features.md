Goal:  Introduction to new features in VCDAT. 

Several very useful navigational and graphical features were added to the
standard VCDAT GUI.

* You can choose to work in VCDAT (full version.html) or in VCDAT Lite 
* You can switch back and forth between the more sophisticated  [full version of VCDAT](to-full-version.html) and the VCDAT Lite in the same session. 
* The navigating features added to both versions of VCDAT include  [extended variable listing. ](variable-list.html)
* Once you selected a variable you will see the variables info displayed at the top of the window. 
* Another great feature is the ability to  [lock and unlock any dimension ](locking-dims.html) .
