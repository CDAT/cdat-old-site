##  Expanded Variable List in VCDAT
Goal: Learn about the expanded variable listing in VCDAT.

The navigating features added to both versions of VCDAT include  extended
variable listing   that includes the _ variables shape  and  long name
together with the  units  _ . The display divides the variables into 1D, 2D,
3D, etc.  dimensions groups  . We think you will come to love that feature.
See the example screen below

Once you selected a variable you will see the variables info displayed at the
top of the window.
