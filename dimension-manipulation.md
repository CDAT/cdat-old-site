##  Dimension Manipulation
Goal:  To introduce you to dimension reordering, and operations.   

Reselect the variable "clt" in the "Variable" selection window. This will
reinitialize the "Dimension Manipulation Panel".  

![Dimension](media/images/dimension)  

Dimension reordering:    

To reorder dimensions, depress the "longitude" axis label button to the far

left:  

![Dimensions_9](media/images/dimensions_9)  

Then move the pointer over the "Re-Order Dimensions" item and select the
desired dimension to reorder. For our example, move the pointer over the
"Y-latitude" menu item to swap the "X-longitude" and "Y-latitude" axes. The
results of this action can be seen below. Notice how the positions of
"longitude" and "latitude" are interchanged.  

![Dimensions_10](media/images/dimensions_10)  

Select the orange "Plot" button to view results. The plotted interchanged
results can be seen in figure 8.  

Dimension function operations:    

To do dimension operations, select the "def" option button to the far right:

![Dimensions_14](media/images/dimensions_14)  

These dimension operations will allow dimension summation, averaging,
geometrical mean, and standard deviation. For our example, average the Z-time
dimension by depressing the "def" menu button and selecting the menu item "avg
user wants average of selected axis points". Notice how the menu button text
is replaced with "avg". See results below.  

![Dimensions_12](media/images/dimensions_12)  

Select the orange "Plot" button to view results. The plotted "time" averaged
results can be seen in figure 9.  

![Dimensions_11](media/images/dimensions_11)  

Figure 8. Interchanged "longitude" and "latitude" axes display results.  

![Dimensions_13](media/images/dimensions_13)  

Figure 9. "Z-time" axis averaged display results.
