#  Starting VCDAT Lite
Goal:  Be able to launch VCDAT Lite and generate a basic data plot. 

To start VCDAT Lite, just type:
    
          vcdat &

By default the VCDAT will open in the Lite Version. You can switch the look
and feel into a full VCDAT version, follow 
[switching defalut to the full version ](changing-default.html) tutorial.

If in the middle of a session you realize that you need to calculate something
you always have an option to 
[switch back to the full version](to-full-version.html)
